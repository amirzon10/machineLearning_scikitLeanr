# machineLearning_scikitLearn
Introduction:

This project was completed as a part of the course Introduction to Machine Learning in Python, powered by IBM. It was the final project which helped me gain honors in the course. The objective of this project was to practice the classification algorithms I learned during the course. The algorithms used in this project are Linear Regression (a non-classification algorithm), KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM. They were evaluated based on the following metrics: Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2-Score.

About the Dataset:

The dataset used in this project was sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. The latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01. The dataset has extra columns like 'RainToday', and the target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01. The column definitions were gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW0000.shtml?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01.
